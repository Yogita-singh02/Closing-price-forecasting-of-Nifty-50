Stock Price Prediction
Main Objectives:
The scope of this project is to build several deep learning algorithms based on RNN techniques which can predict future values of an indicator using Time-Series Forecasting methods in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy. This can be broken down into the following milestones:

Data Exploration and evaluation of Stationarity. Modeling and selection of best model. Prediction of future values
